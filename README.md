# STM32 TMC5130 stepper driver
 Stepper driver for Trinamic TMC5130 BOB. Still work in progress!
 Currently tested on STM32F4 boards. 
 Supports multiple steppers and stallguard functionality.

Code is taken from their Evalboard firmware and cuzomised, which explains some unused files and snippets of code. Will clean it up soon.
